## General info
Owing to COVID19, since it is not possible to conduct programming hackathons, which provide opportunities to meet other programmers directly and grow one's programming ability for novice programmers, we created a platform 'Forecst' that opens hackathons for them. 

Forecst helps users to get easily motivated to keep doing their work on their project by seeing the freely, easily shared development processes and compete with others through the ranking made at the end of the hackathon. Users can also grow a 'forest' together, which is a collection of 'trees'(an object that the user gets to grow through earning points by doing some activities in the platform) of each user.
